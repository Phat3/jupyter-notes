    "\n",
    "#### Collision free\n",
    "I can't find x and y such as:\n",
    "- **x != y && H(x) == H(Y)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application** : Message digest --> since the probability to find two inputs that maps on the same output is negligible, we can say that the hash of a given message identifies uniquely the message itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hiding\n",
    "- **Given H(x) I can't find x**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to guarantee this property we need to chose x among a huge set of different possible inputs\n",

    "We can say that **r HIDES x**!!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application** : Commitment --> Once I commit to a message I'm not able to repudiate the message anymore\n",
    "\n",
    "Commitment must have two important properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Hiding : given the commitment I'm not able to figure out what the message is \n",
    "    2. Binding : I can't find another message msg' that, with the same key, has the same commitment as the original message msg\n",
    "\n",
    "**API**:\n",
    "   - **COMMIT(msg)** : H(key|msg), key\n",
    "   - **VERIFY(commitment, msg, key)** : H(key|msg) == commitment\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Puzzle-friendly\n",
    "For every possible output y I can't find k such as:\n",
    "- **H(k|x) == y**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application** : Puzzle search --> Given a puzzle ID and a target set of output Y try to find a solution x such that H(ID|x) belongs to Y\n",
