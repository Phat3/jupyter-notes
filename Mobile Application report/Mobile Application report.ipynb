    "In order to access this applicaton, the user must connect his Facebook account and share some of his informations like photos and interests.\n",
    "Once the user has been successfully logged in the application, he can discover all the people that are using Tinfinity near to him using the map as shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "If the user find someone interesting on the map, he can tap on the marker and send a friendship request as shown in Figure 2. When and if recipient accepts the request, they can start chatting and maybe know each other directly in person.\n",
    "Also, when the friendship is granted, the two users can continue to chat even if they are no longer near such a normal chat system as Whatsapp for example.\n",
    "The user can also personalize which informations have to be shared with other through the settings page as shown in Figure 3.\n",
    "(In order to improve the location system is possible to activate the augmented reality mode that shown the marker of the other users using the phone camera as shown in figure 4.).\n",
    "The application works in background and there is no need to open it in order to be localized by the others on the map (but the user can switch to the offline mode iat every moment)\n",
